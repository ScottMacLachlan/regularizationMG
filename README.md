# regularizationMG

Repo for LaTeX source for manuscript describing a multigrid method for a class of regularized inverse problems

## Todo list

* Stopping criterion for outer iteration
* Plot data error (normalized against noise norm) and reg. error 
* Second example: heart & lungs phantom??  MRI phantom??
* Test new MG algorithm: robustness to noise and examples

## Outline / writing tasks
* Write introduction (Misha)
* Description of problem setup and outer/inner algorithm
* Description of the MG algorithm (Matthias/Scott)
* Description of L-curve trimming (Scott?)
* Numerical results
* Conclusions
