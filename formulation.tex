In this paper, we focus on an iterative approach to the solution of
ill-posed problems arising from the use of non-quadratic
regularization terms.  Consider the regularized system
\[
\min_x \|Kx-b\|^2 + \lambda^2 \mathcal{R}(x),
\]
where $\mathcal{R}(x)$ is some regularization term and $\lambda$ is
the regularization parameter, to be chosen using a standard L-curve
approach \cite{OlearyHansen,etc} or other means.  We specifically
consider the case where $\mathcal{R}(x) \approx \|Lx\|_\ast^2$, for
some norm (or weaker measure) applied to the discrete gradient of $x$.
